# Fly

Execute a preflight checklist. Walks tasks, dispatches subagents, fills slots, auto-fixes review findings, verifies completion.

## Purpose

Execute a preflight checklist by:
1. Dispatching implementer subagents using upstream prompt templates (read at runtime from the superpowers plugin cache).
2. Running spec and code reviewers; auto-dispatching fix-implementers on findings.
3. Filling SHA, Outcome, and Resolution slots in the checklist as work progresses.
4. Running phase-level and final review gates per the checklist.
5. Final verification sweep: all boxes ticked, all slots filled, deep-review invariant satisfied.

`/fly` does NOT invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` as a skill. It owns its per-task loop and uses that skill's prompt templates by reading them at runtime.

## Triggers

User invokes `/fly <checklist-path>` - typically in a fresh Claude Code session for clean context.

## Input

- **Primary:** path to a preflight checklist file (produced by `/preflight`).
- **Implicit:** the original plan file referenced in the checklist's `READ FIRST` header. `/fly` reads both - the plan for task content (code, commands, file paths) and the checklist for gates and decisions.

## State Detection

On entry, read the checklist file and classify its state:

- **Fresh run** - all checkboxes are unticked (`- [ ]`) and all slots contain `<fill>`.
- **Mid-flight pickup** - some checkboxes are ticked (`- [x]`) or some slots are non-`<fill>`. Resume from the first unticked checkbox or unfilled slot.
- **Already complete** - every checkbox ticked, every slot filled, verification block ticked. Print "Already complete. Nothing to do." and exit.

Announce the detected mode at start:
- Fresh run: "Flying <checklist>. Mode: fresh run."
- Mid-flight: "Flying <checklist>. Mode: resuming from Task <X.Y>."
- Complete: "Already complete. Nothing to do."
